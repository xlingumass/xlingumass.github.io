From the command line:\npython Scripts/makeRegions.py 'annotated_sents.txt'\nwhere you pass the name of the file you just made as a command-line argument to makeRegions.py. This should create a file called ‘output.reg.txt’ in which every line looks like this:\n17 81 6 0 0 24 0 31 0 37 0 46 0 66 0 (COND#) (ITEM NO.) (NO. REGIONS) (X1START) (Y1START) (X2START) (Y2START) (X3START) (Y3START) ...  For single line experiments, only the XSTART bits matter. In this example, for Item 81, Condition 17, the first region begins at (character) 0 and goes up to but does not include character 24; the second region begins at 24, and goes up to but does not include 31; and so on.\nattention “Look over your work!” Errors in regioning are super easy to make, super difficult to notice later on, and mess up your data like crazy.\nTake the output.reg.txt file, and inspect it carefully at this point. Check that every item has the number of regions you expect, and check that they all look right. Sample a couple of lines randomly, and confirm by hand that the region limits in output.reg.txt are indeed what they should be. If you have a very predictable manipulation (e.g you know the region limits in condition 2 should always be one character later than in condition 1), then you should also eyeball all the regions and confirm that they fit the template.\nYou’ll need this (double-checked!) file later on.\nCreating a script file using Scripter2 Assuming you have your items in a spreadsheet, you can use Scripter2 to format them the way the Eyetrack program requires. You’ll need to organize your items as required by Scripter2, all items following this order (the header isn’t used, so the naming doesn’t matter):\n   Condition Item Dependent Trial Type Answer Timeout (in ms) Sentence 1 (Sentence 2)      Items formatted for use with Scripter2.\nFor an explanation of the formatting and detailed description of the columns, see chapter 1 of this manual, written by Matthew Abbott while he was an undergraduate RA in Adrian Staub’s lab.\nAfter you export the sheet as a tab-delimited file, it should look something like this:\nThe exported text file to use with Scripter2.\nIn this example, experimental items have conditions 1-4, questions have condition 100, filler items have condition 200, and filler questions have condition 300. Doublecheck that you’ve coded the conditions properly, and that questions are marked as dependent on their respective item.\nFrom the command line, navigate to the directory that has scripter2 and your items and then run Scripter2.\nRunning Scripter2 from the command line – this should be the same across operating systems.\nYou should specify the name of the input and output files, but can simply skip the specifications for x and y if you’re not making any display changes. You definitely do want to generate sequences.\nThe resulting output file should look similar to this:\nThe trial at the top is essentially a key, made from the header – before running the script, you should delete it.\nIn your preferred text editor, copy the following above the items in your script file:\n%BeginHeader Conditions = E1-4 Question = E100 Items 1-48 Fillers Condition = F200 Questions = F300 Items = 49-119 %EndHeader set conditions = 5 set experiments = 2 set expConditions = 4 1 set background = 16777215 set foreground = 0 set filterMode = 2 set windowThreshold = 0 set calibration_type = 0 set display_type = LCD trial_type Message text_format = 'Monaco' 12 25 20 20 nonantialiased text_weight = normal non-italic button = Y button = X button = B button = A button = toggle button = leftTrigger button = rightTrigger output = nostream trigger = nogaze cursor_size = 0 dc_delay = 0 stimulus_delay = 0 revert = 0 highlight_color =197148 end Message trial_type question text_format = 'Monaco' 12 48 15 268 nonantialiased text_weight = normal non-italic button = leftTrigger button = rightTrigger output = nostream trigger = nogaze cursor_size = 0 dc_delay = 0 stimulus_delay = 0 revert = 0 highlight_color =1639238 end question trial_type sentence text_format = 'Monaco' 11 24 18 315 nonantialiased text_weight = normal non-italic button = Y button = X button = B button = A button = toggle button = leftTrigger button = rightTrigger output = stream trigger = gaze cursor_size = 0 dc_delay = 0 stimulus_delay = 0 revert = 0 highlight_color =2163302 end sentence Edit the header and variables to match your items, as well as any parameters you’d like to change, such as the gaze condition. When running subjects, set the trigger for trial_type sentence equal to gaze, but if you would like a version of the experiment which doesn’t require the participant to hit a gaze box (for your own testing purposes, or so that you don’t collect data from certain subjects, for example), set it equal to nogaze.\nControlling your lists Open the script file on the host computer connected to the eyetracking machine. You can test the script by opening it in EyeTrack. You should test each condition in your script. See handy dandy randomizer.py  Brian did to create your own lists.\nRunning an eyetracking experiment Tip “Things to keep in mind with running logs”\n  Imagine that you need to figure out whether a particular person took your experiment and if so when, but for some reason the consent form with their name on it doesn’t have a listed subject number. Can you do it?\n  The IRB sometimes asks for number of subjects and their gender at the end of the semester. Make that easy for yourself.\n  Figure out in advance how you are going to label subjects that leave half way through (maybe you can’t track them) and non-native speakers. Do you rename that file and give the next person that subject number, or do you just go on to the next subject number? Whichever you choose, stay consistent! Document what you do when you do it.\n  After you’ve run a participant, save their data file, making sure the filename is 6 characters or less (e.g. EYE002.edf).\nAnalyzing data Preparing your data for analysis To do anything further with the data, you’ll have to convert it from .edf to .asc. On the host computer, open the command line and navigate to the directory with the .edf files in it. edf2asc *.edf creates .asc versions of all the .edf files in that directory.\nWe need to parse the .asc files into a series of fixations we can match against the regioned sentences from earlier. We’ll use Robodoc to do this. You’ll need to edit the parameter file (parameter.txt, in RoboDoc_and_utils/Robodoc) to specify the directory you’ve stored your .asc files in and the region file you made earlier, as well as to reflect the exclusion criteria you’d like to use. Once you’ve edited the parameters, hop into the command line and run Robodoc: Robodoc.py edited_parameters.txt. If everything’s gone smoothly, you’ll have a folder of DA1 files as well as several folders and files detailing what files were processed, excluded, and kept, as well as blink information for each subject.\nIt’s at this point that we’ll use SideEye to process the DA1 files into measures we can analyze. (Note: SideEye requires Python = 3.5. It’s easiest to install with pip: in Python, pip install sideeye.)\nFrom the examples folder, copy sample.py and sample_config.json into the directory containing a folder of DA1 files and a .cnt or .reg region file. Open both files in a text editor. Replace the file paths in sample.py with paths to your DA1 and region files. Replace sample_output.csv with whatever you want the output file to be named. Edit sample_config.json to match the parameters needed for your experiment. See the readme.rst for more information.\nThe resulting output file should look like this: Templates and examples Running logs Example running log\nabove log has been edited to preserve privacy of participants\nExample log template\n","wordCount":"1474","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://xlingumass.github.io/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Christian Muxica"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://xlingumass.github.io/docs/eyetracking/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"XLing Labs | UMass","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.umass.edu/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><script defer src=/static/fontawesome/fontawesome-all.js></script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://xlingumass.github.io accesskey=h title="XLing Labs (Alt + H)">XLing Labs</a>

Can you do it?</p></li><li><p>The IRB sometimes asks for number of subjects and their gender at the end of the semester. Make that easy for yourself.</p></li><li><p>Figure out in advance how you are going to label subjects that leave half way through (maybe you can&rsquo;t track them) and non-native speakers. Do you rename that file and give the next person that subject number, or do you just go on to the next subject number? Whichever you choose, stay consistent! Document what you do when you do it.</p></li></ol><p>After you&rsquo;ve run a participant, save their data file, making sure the filename is 6 characters or less (e.g. EYE002.edf).</p><h3 id=analyzing-data>Analyzing data<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#analyzing-data>#</a></h3><h4 id=preparing-your-data-for-analysis>Preparing your data for analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#preparing-your-data-for-analysis>#</a></h4><p>To do anything further with the data, you&rsquo;ll have to convert it from .edf to .asc. On the host computer, open the command line and navigate to the directory with the .edf files in it. <code>edf2asc *.edf</code> creates .asc versions of all the .edf files in that directory.</p><p>We need to parse the .asc files into a series of fixations we can match against the regioned sentences from earlier. We&rsquo;ll use Robodoc<a href=https://blogs.umass.edu/eyelab/software/RoboDoc_and_utils.zip>
<i class="fas fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>to do this. You&rsquo;ll need to edit the parameter file (parameter.txt, in RoboDoc_and_utils/Robodoc) to specify the directory you&rsquo;ve stored your .asc files in and the region file you made earlier, as well as to reflect the exclusion criteria you&rsquo;d like to use. <img loading=lazy src alt="image of editing parameters.txt"></p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve edited the parameters, hop into the command line and run Robodoc: <code>Robodoc.py edited_parameters.txt</code>. <img loading=lazy src alt="image of cmd line, etc printouts"></p><p>If everything&rsquo;s gone smoothly, you&rsquo;ll have a folder of DA1 files as well as several folders and files detailing what files were processed, excluded, and kept, as well as blink information for each subject.</p><p>It&rsquo;s at this point that we&rsquo;ll use SideEye<a href=https://github.com/amnda-d/sideeye>
<i class="fas fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>to process the DA1 files into measures we can analyze. (Note: SideEye requires Python >= 3.5. It&rsquo;s easiest to install with pip: in Python, <code>pip install sideeye</code>.)</p><p>From the examples folder, copy <code>sample.py</code> and <code>sample_config.json</code> into the directory containing a folder of DA1 files and a .cnt or .reg region file. Open both files in a text editor. Replace the file paths in <code>sample.py</code> with paths to your DA1 and region files. Replace <code>sample_output.csv</code> with whatever you want the output file to be named. Edit <code>sample_config.json</code> to match the parameters needed for your experiment. See the readme.rst for more information.</p><p>The resulting output file should look like this: <img loading=lazy src=/images/guide-images/outputcsv.png alt="Output file"></p><h2 id=templates-and-examples>Templates and examples<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#templates-and-examples>#</a></h2><h4 id=running-logs>Running logs<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#running-logs>#</a></h4><p>Example running log<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OJMycWVKSxMyMxGBj2nvOhCwrskPeOB14_XktqZa02Y/edit?usp=sharing">
